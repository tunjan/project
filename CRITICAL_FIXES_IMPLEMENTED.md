# Critical Fixes Implemented

This document summarizes the critical security vulnerabilities and architectural issues that have been addressed in the codebase.

## üîí Security Fixes

### 1. Permissions System Overhaul (`src/config/permissions.ts`)

#### Critical Security Vulnerability: Context-Free Permissions

**Problem**: The permissions system had a dangerous fall-through case that granted destructive permissions like `DELETE_CHAPTER`, `EDIT_CHAPTER`, and `MANAGE_INVENTORY` without proper context validation.

**Impact**: A Regional Organiser could delete/edit chapters in other countries, and Chapter Organisers could perform destructive actions outside their scope.

**Fix Implemented**:

- Added explicit `case` blocks for all destructive permissions
- Each permission now requires proper context validation:
  - `DELETE_CHAPTER`: Regional Organisers can only delete chapters in their country, Chapter Organisers cannot delete chapters
  - `EDIT_CHAPTER`: Regional Organisers can only edit chapters in their country, Chapter Organisers can only edit their own chapters
  - `MANAGE_INVENTORY`: Scoped to appropriate geographic/organizational boundaries
- Changed default case from `return true` to `return false` for security-by-default

#### Redundant Role Elimination

**Problem**: Both `GODMODE` and `GLOBAL_ADMIN` roles had identical permissions, creating unnecessary complexity.

**Fix Implemented**:

- Kept `GODMODE` as a special development bypass role
- Added production environment warning for `GODMODE` usage
- `GLOBAL_ADMIN` remains the highest functional role

#### VERIFY_USER Permission Fix

**Problem**: Chapter Organisers were granted `VERIFY_USER` permission but the logic always returned `false`.

**Fix Implemented**:

- Added proper logic for Chapter Organisers to verify users within their chapters
- Maintained hierarchy checks for Regional Organisers and above

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Fixes

### 2. State Management Race Condition (`src/store/users.store.ts`)

#### Onboarding Logic Duplication

**Problem**: Onboarding advancement logic was duplicated between `batchUpdateUserStats` and `advanceOnboardingAfterEvent`, creating race conditions.

**Fix Implemented**:

- Removed onboarding logic from `batchUpdateUserStats`
- `batchUpdateUserStats` now only updates user statistics
- Onboarding advancement is handled exclusively by `advanceOnboardingAfterEvent`
- This eliminates the race condition and makes the system more predictable

#### Application Submission Notification

**Problem**: New users received no confirmation that their application was submitted successfully.

**Fix Implemented**:

- Added notification for newly registered users
- Users now receive immediate feedback about their application status

### 3. Navigation Performance (`src/components/search/CommandPalette.tsx`)

#### Full Page Reload on Navigation

**Problem**: Search results used `window.location.href` causing full page reloads and destroying SPA state.

**Fix Implemented**:

- Replaced `window.location.href` with React Router's `useNavigate` hook
- Maintains SPA behavior and preserves application state
- Improves user experience and performance

### 4. Scorecard Utility (`src/utils/scorecard.ts`)

#### Misleading Function Names and Placeholder Logic

**Problem**: Functions had misleading names and contained placeholder calculations that could lead to incorrect business decisions.

**Fix Implemented**:

- Added comprehensive TODO comments explaining what needs to be implemented
- Documented that current calculations are placeholders
- Clarified that `retentionScore` is not a true retention rate
- Added implementation requirements for `avgTurnout` calculation

## üö® Remaining Critical Issues

### Performance Issues (Not Fixed - Requires Backend Changes)

The following issues were identified but require significant backend architecture changes:

1. **Client-Side Data Aggregation** (`src/utils/analytics.ts`, `src/utils/leaderboard.ts`)
   - Complex data processing performed on client-side
   - O(N\*M) complexity that will degrade exponentially with data growth
   - **Recommendation**: Move to backend with pre-computed results and dedicated API endpoints

2. **Automated Organizer Re-assignment** (`src/store/users.store.ts`)
   - Dangerous automatic promotion logic when deleting users
   - Could create unwanted role combinations
   - **Recommendation**: Replace with notification system for manual intervention

## üîß Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: All critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed
2. **Short-term**: Monitor the fixes for any unintended side effects
3. **Medium-term**: Plan backend migration for analytics and leaderboard calculations
4. **Long-term**: Implement proper retention tracking and turnout calculations

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

1. Test permission boundaries for Regional Organisers across different countries
2. Verify Chapter Organisers cannot perform destructive actions outside their scope
3. Test onboarding flow to ensure no duplicate advancement logic
4. Verify search navigation maintains SPA behavior
5. Test GODMODE role in production environment (should show warning)
