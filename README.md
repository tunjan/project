Vegan Action Hub is a comprehensive, feature-rich platform designed to empower vegan activists and organizers. It provides a centralized hub for managing chapters, organizing events ("Cubes of Truth"), tracking outreach impact, and fostering a global community dedicated to animal advocacy.

The application is built with a modern, brutalist design aesthetic and features a robust set of tools for both individual activists and chapter organizers, including detailed analytics, role-based access control, and a sophisticated mock data generation pipeline for development and testing.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/vegan-action-hub.git
    cd vegan-action-hub
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    - Maps use free OpenStreetMap tiles via Leaflet - no API keys required!

4.  **Generate mock data:**
    - The application relies on a generated TypeScript file for all its data. Run the TypeScript script to create it.

    ```bash
    npm run generate-data
    ```

    This will create `src/data/mockData.ts` which is imported by the application's state management.

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with Hot Module Replacement.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally.
- `npm run test`: Runs the test suite using Vitest.
- `npm run coverage`: Runs tests and generates a coverage report.
- `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
- `npm run format`: Formats all files using Prettier.
- `npm run generate-data`: Generates mock data using the TypeScript script.

## üìä Mock Data Generation

This project includes a sophisticated TypeScript script (`scripts/generate-mock-data.ts`) to create realistic and deeply interconnected mock data using `@faker-js/faker`.

**Key Features:**

- **Realistic Data:** Generates users with varied activity levels, roles, and chapter affiliations.
- **Data Relationships:** Creates logical connections between users, events, and chapters.
- **TypeScript Native:** Runs directly within your Node.js environment without needing Python.
- **Typed Output:** Generates a fully typed `mockData.ts` file, ensuring type safety throughout the application.

For more details, see the [Mock Data Documentation](./README_MOCK_DATA.md).

## üé® Design System

The application features a "Modern Brutalism" design system implemented with Tailwind CSS. Key characteristics include:

- Sharp corners (no border-radius).
- Strong, 2px black borders on most elements.
- Bold typography using the "Libre Franklin" font.
- A high-contrast, limited color palette with semantic color names (`primary`, `success`, `danger`).
- Brutal-style box shadows (`4px 4px 0 #000`).
- A library of reusable UI components in `src/components/ui`.

For more details on its implementation, see the [Design System Updates Summary](./DESIGN_SYSTEM_UPDATES.md).

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

The project is configured for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The `vercel.json` file includes:

- Build configurations for a standard Vite/React project.
- Robust security headers, including a Content Security Policy (CSP), to enhance application security.
